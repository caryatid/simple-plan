# file cleaning
# should this clean the text?
# i.e. convert all tabs to spaces?

# read each line sequentially
# count the number of spaces/tabs

# assign the number of spaces to a directory level

# dave used a create leaf function,
# this would serve to identify the
# end of a file system

# d also mentioned converting each line 
# as a file unless a new file is discovered
# below it. 

# read line
# count spaces
# assign level in tree to line

# create new file

# if file has leaf below
# turn it into a node
    # remove file, create dir with same file name
    # move into that dir
