1) take the example format, TODO.txt, and make it into a filesystem structure. 
2) generate a directory of symlinks to all of the files within that filesystem strucuture.
3) implement a way to present those symlinks in an orderable manner
4) present possible improvements. For example, does this need its own search or can it simply use grep
